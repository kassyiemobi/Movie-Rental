# Movie-Rental
This was a task for a project during my internship with Genesys Tech Hub, Do not mind the UI , it wasn't graded because this was a Backend Task and what mattered is the Javascript code. Decided to upload it because it was really tasking and i learnt a whole lot while at it.

This app allows you to search for any movie of your interest and rent it out.

The javascript code, made it possible for the code to be able to delete a rented movie, and also gave the search button its functionality.

The entire project was based on object oriented programming
